# AirMonApp-Arduino-IoT
The code used for NodeMCU, to get values from sensors, and upload them to firebase and UbiDots.

## Things you need to know
1. NodeMCU with 5 sensors - there are 2 of them, cause one was not enough, so 2 files.
2. Arduino IDE is used, so code is written in Embedded C probably.
3. You need to install libraries for NodeMCU. If I get enough time, will add full procedure.
